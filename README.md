# holoENclipper
Holo EN Clipper is a website made by another developer and I. The website is designed to play a clip of Hololive EN members in, correspondence to selected tags inputted by the user. This was made through the use of a YouTube API, searching the inputted tags, and then changing the video at the bottom.
